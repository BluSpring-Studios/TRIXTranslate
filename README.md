[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/unitytranslate) · [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unitytranslate) · [Discord](https://discord.gg/ECGejX4WFA) · [Support the Developer!](https://ko-fi.com/bluspring) 

A Minecraft mod designed for free live translation, inspired by the QSMP.

Created primarily for the [Unity Multiplayer](https://twitter.com/UnityUpdatesEN) server, and released publicly for the multilingual Minecraft community.

### Installation
Official releases of UnityTranslate can be downloaded from the official [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/unitytranslate) and [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unitytranslate) pages.<br>
For communicating with your multilingual friends, the [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) mod is recommended to be installed alongside UnityTranslate.

You may also require [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to be able to use the voice transcription (speech-to-text) system.
Other browsers are not guaranteed to support the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).

### Credits & Acknowledgements
Thank you to [Argos Open Tech](https://www.argosopentech.com/) for developing [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com) & [ArgosTranslate](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate).<br>
Without LibreTranslate, this project would have been made significantly more expensive, and the translation system would
have been impossible to develop for free.
